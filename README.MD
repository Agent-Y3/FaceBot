## Installation

To install and start FaceBot, simply follow these two steps:

1. **Run the installation script**:
   - Make sure Python 3.10 or higher is installed.
   - Save `install_facebot.py` to `%userprofile%\Downloads`.
   - Open a Command Prompt and run the script:
     ```bash
     cd Downloads
     python3 install_facebot.py
     ```
   - The script will set up the virtual environment (`C:\facebot_env`), install all required Python modules, and provide instructions for installing WinSCP and PuTTY.

2. **Start FaceBot**:
   - Save `facebot.py` to `%userprofile%\Downloads`.
   - Activate the virtual environment and start the bot:
     ```bash
     C:\facebot_env\Scripts\activate
     cd Downloads
     python3 facebot.py
     ```
   - A GUI window will open. You can type or speak commands like “Open Edge,” “Play Shape of You,” or “Search for xAI.”
